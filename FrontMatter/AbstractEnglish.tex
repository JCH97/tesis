%	Traditional statistics deals mainly with the association between variables but does not reveal information about the causal relationships between them. Based on these limitations, it is necessary to build a theory that mathematically formalizes causal processes. This theory will allow modeling everyday life situations and answering causal questions about them. A more ambitious goal is the simulation of human causal reasoning, which is believed to be a fundamental piece in building strong artificial intelligence. In this paper, the main recent developments of computational mathematical theories of causality will be presented, with special emphasis on the work of Judea Pearl, and an implementation of a causal model capable of answering different types of causal questions will be provided. Finally, possible scenarios are exposed where the proposed program can be used.
