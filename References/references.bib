The causal revolution, instigated by Judea Pearl and his colleagues, has cut through a century of confusion and established causality-the study of cause and effect-on a firm scientific basis. His work explains how we can know easy things, like whether it was rain or a sprinkler that made a sidewalk wet; and how to answer hard questions, like whether a drug cured an illness. Pearl's work enables us to know not just whether one thing causes another: it lets us explore the world that is and the worlds that could have been. It shows us the essence of human thought and key to artificial intelligence.},

 abstract = {There occurs on some occasions a difficulty in deciding the direction of causality between two related variables and also whether or not feedback is occurring. Testable definitions of causality and feedback are proposed and illustrated by use of simple two-variable models. The important problem of apparent instantaneous causality is discussed and it is suggested that the problem often arises due to slowness in recording information or because a sufficiently wide class of possible causal variables has not been used. It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalisation of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested.},

abstract = {From the Publisher: Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems is a complete andaccessible
account of the theoretical foundations and computational methods that underlie plausible
reasoning under uncertainty. The author provides a coherent explication of probability
as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective
on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth
maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and
semantic approaches to uncertaintyand offers techniques, based on belief networks,
that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically,
network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical
coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology:
modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed
computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation,
multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech
recognitionin short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain
clues and incomplete information. Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will
be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics,
logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals
in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics
will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book
can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations
research, or applied probability.}

For these reasons, numerous researchers are exploring the use of belief networks as a knowledge representation in artificial intelligence. Algorithms have been developed previously for efficient probabilistic inference using special classes of belief networks. More general classes of belief networks, however, have eluded efforts to develop efficient inference algorithms. We show that probabilistic inference using belief networks is NP-hard. Therefore, it seems unlikely that an exact algorithm can be developed to perform probabilistic inference efficiently over all classes of belief networks. This result suggests that research should be directed away from the search for a general, efficient probabilistic inference algorithm, and toward the design of efficient special-case, average-case, and approximation algorithms.}

Many investigators in the AI community have tacitly assumed that algorithms for performing approximate inference with belief networks are of polynomial complexity. Indeed, special cases of approximate inference can be performed in time polynomial in the input size. However, we have discovered that the general problem of approximating conditional probabilities with belief networks, like exact inference, resides in the NP-hard complexity class. We develop a complexity analysis to elucidate the difficulty of approximate probabilistic inference. More specifically, we show that the existence of a polynomial-time relative approximation algorithm for major classes of problem instances implies that NP ⊆ P. We present our proof and explore the implications of the result.}

Numerous researchers using such models employ some graph representation for the distributions, such as a Bayesian belief network. This representation simplifies the complexity of specifying the distributions from exponential in n, the number of variables in the model, to linear in n, in many interesting cases. We show, however, that finding the MAP is NP-hard in the general case when these representations are used, even if the size of the representation happens to be linear in n. Furthermore, minor modifications to the proof show that the problem remains NP-hard for various restrictions of the topology of the graphs. The same technique can be applied to the results of a related paper (by Cooper), to further restrict belief network topology in the proof that probabilistic inference is NP-hard.}

Shimony has shown that finding MAPs is NP-hard. In this paper, we show that approximating MAPs with a constant ratio bound is also NP-hard. In addition, we examine the complexity of two related problems which have been mentioned in the literature. We show that given the MAP for a belief network and evidence set, or the family of MAPs if the optimal is not unique, it remains NP-hard to find, or approximate, alternative next-best explanations. Furthermore, we show that given the MAP, or MAPs, for a belief network and an initial evidence set, it is also NP-hard to find, or approximate, the MAP assignment for the same belief network with a modified evidence set that differs from the initial set by the addition or removal of even a single node assignment. Finally, we show that our main result applies to networks with constrained in-degree and out-degree, applies to randomized approximation, and even still applies if the ratio bound, instead of being constant, is allowed to be a polynomial function of various aspects of the network topology.}

abstract = {Belief networks are directed acyclic graphs in which the nodes represent propositions (or variables), the arcs signify direct dependencies between the linked propositions, and the strengths of these dependencies are quantified by conditional probabilities. A network of this sort can be used to represent the generic knowledge of a domain expert, and it turns into a computational architecture if the links are used not merely for storing factual knowledge but also for directing and activating the data flow in the computations which manipulate this knowledge. The first part of the paper deals with the task of fusing and propagating the impacts of new information through the networks in such a way that, when equilibrium is reached, each proposition will be assigned a measure of belief consistent with the axioms of probability theory. It is shown that if the network is singly connected (e.g. tree-structured), then probabilities can be updated by local propagation in an isomorphic network of parallel and autonomous processors and that the impact of new information can be imparted to all propositions in time proportional to the longest path in the network. The second part of the paper deals with the problem of finding a tree-structured representation for a collection of probabilistically coupled propositions using auxiliary (dummy) variables, colloquially called “hidden causes.” It is shown that if such a tree-structured representation exists, then it is possible to uniquely uncover the topology of the tree by observing pairwise dependencies among the available propositions (i.e., the leaves of the tree). The entire tree structure, including the strengths of all internal relationships, can be reconstructed in time proportional to n log n, where n is the number of leaves.}

We consider the problem from the combinatorial optimization point of view and state that efficient probabilistic inference in a belief network is a problem of finding an optimal factoring given a set of probability distributions. From this viewpoint, previously developed algorithms can be seen as alternative factoring strategies. In this paper, we define a combinatorial optimization problem, the optimal factoring problem, and discuss application of this problem in belief networks. We show that optimal factoring provides insight into the key elements of efficient probabilistic inference, and demonstrate simple, easily implemented algorithms with excellent performance.}
